# Documentation Home

Welcome to the **Sample GitHub Pages Site** documentation.

This project demonstrates how to use the **GithubPagesConnector** to index a GitHub Pages website.  
It includes several pages, guides, and tutorials to simulate a real-world documentation site.

## Sections

- [About](about.md)
- [Guide](guide/getting-started.md)
- [Tutorials](tutorials/basic-setup.md)

Our documentation site is designed to replicate realistic developer documentation, containing multiple sections and detailed explanations to test connector indexing performance.
