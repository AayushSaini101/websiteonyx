# Advanced Usage Tutorial

For more complex scenarios:

- **Multiple Branches:** Use a dedicated `gh-pages` branch for deployment.
- **Custom Domains:** Configure a `CNAME` file for your custom URL.
- **Access Control:** Use GitHub authentication tokens for private sites.
- **Incremental Updates:** Connector can fetch only changed pages based on commit history.

Advanced use cases simulate real-world enterprise documentation deployments.
