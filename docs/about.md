# About

The **Sample GitHub Pages Site** is designed for testing indexing capabilities of connectors.  
This site mimics a real documentation website structure.

Key Features:
- Hosted on GitHub Pages.
- Contains multiple pages (Markdown and HTML).
- Provides structured content for indexing and search.

It helps validate:
1. **Page Discovery** – Connector can find all docs.
2. **Content Extraction** – Pages are parsed correctly.
3. **URL Mapping** – Each page links to its final GitHub Pages URL.

### Additional Details

This site includes various types of documents such as FAQs, Guides, and Tutorials that mirror real-world use cases for open-source project documentation.
